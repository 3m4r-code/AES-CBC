File encryption/decryption program written in C, implementing AES in CBC mode with PKCS#7 padding.

This program was done for an undergraduate training project in practical cryptography.

The main purpose of writing this program was to learn about the AES encryption algorithm along with the encryption modes and the padding schemes. 
And then to implement them in a useful application in the C language.
