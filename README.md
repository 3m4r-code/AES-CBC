File encryption/decryption program written in C, implementing AES in CBC mode with PKCS#7 padding.

This program was done for an undergraduate training project in practical cryptography.

The main purpose of writing this program was to learn about the AES encryption algorithm along with the encryption modes and the padding schemes. 
And then to implement them in a useful application in the C language.

-To use program:
First compile the source file
Then in the command line write (in order): 
[executable] [encrypt or decrypt] [key size in bits (128 or 192 or 256)] [key (16 or 24 or 32 bytes long)] [IV (16 bytes long)] [input file path] [output file path]
